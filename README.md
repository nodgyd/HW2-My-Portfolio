# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
- The motivation behind this project was to deepen my knowledge in html semantics and advanced CSS!
- Built this project as a launch for when I apply for jobs to prove my work/skills!
- What problem does it solve? I solved a lot of problems when learning how to utilize flexboxes and media queries.
- I learned a lot about the interaction with flexboxes and how to setup a page based on where you want to put specific items within a container.
